# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
CNN for CIFAR-10 Image Classification

**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

This repository contains a CNN model for CIFAR-10 Image Classification.

It includes the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and a readme.

**2) Which dataset has been used and where to find it?**

CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset provided by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR). 
This dataset is used in many types of deep learning research for object recognition. The Keras dataset module already comes with the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**3) What does the dataset contain?**

The ‘10’ in this CIFAR-10 dataset refers to 10 classes. These 10 classes are — Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship and Truck respectively.

There are 60,000, 32x32 color images from these 10 classes, with 6000 images from each class. The training dataset contains 50,000 training images and the test dataset contains 10,000 test images.

Details of the Image classification and model setup are discussed in my article https://devashree-madhugiri.medium.com/using-cnn-for-image-classification-on-cifar-10-dataset-7803d9f3b983 published on Medium.
